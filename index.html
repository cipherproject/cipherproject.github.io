      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        <b>CIPHER</b> was built to predict <b>C</b>yberattack <b>I</b>mpacts, <b>P</b>atient <b>H</b>arms and effective <b>E</b>mergency <b>R</b>esponse.
        The CIPHER models on this page draw from the datasets described on the <a href="https://www.thecipherplatform.com">project website</a>, consisting of the <b><i>"Hospital Attacks"</i></b> database (drawn from academic literature)
        and the <b><i>"Patient Harms"</i></b> database (drawn from social media posts). From these two data sources we created the full <CIPHER dataset>, available in the data folder,
        which provides over 300 patient-level harms reported to have occured following a healthcare cyberattack.
        The CIPHER model below displays these patient safety incidents, as they emerge over time
        from the onset of the cyberattack, across the different clinical specialties and affected technical domanis.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        The models are displayed as an <b>interactive "Hospital at Ransom" cube</b> below, which is a demo model developed for a hypothetical hospital context.
        For these models to be effective for local hospital context, users would need to update the underlying data for the likely clinical impact in their hospitals. 
        For instance, we have assigned 'Clinical Impact' scores to each patient safety incident, based on the likely effect in our hypothetical hospital (e.g. this hospital
        has a heavy reliance on e-Prescribing in the ER, thus loss of digital drug release would have a high degree of impact. By downloading the underlying datasets
        and updating this to local hospital contexts, users can utilise the database of cyberattack-induced patient safety incidents and tailor the model to their circumstances.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        The demo model can illustrate how to <b>minimise clinical surprise</b> during
        hospital cyberattacks, by anticipating dangerous patient safety events that may occur. By showcasing these diverse events, assigning clinical impact scores and identifying
        the at-risk patient groups and necessary medical interventions, these models can be used to enhance Cyberattack incident response processes to protect patient care. All of these incidents are plotted on the 3D plot below, which structures these
        incidents by time (from the first hour of the attack to one month later), and technological dependency (the compromised domain responsible for the harm). The result
        is an interactive 3D plot visualising patient safety incidents emerging over time during the cyberattack, which can be customised to a local hospitals context and their specific technical dependencies.

As with plain radiography, the only way to view these images in detail was at the CT unit itself. Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome. However, it could also be extremely challenging, for example, when two or more patients with similar injuries required a CT scan for surgical planning. Decision-makers could be placed in the difficult situation where the patient\u2019s best interest, to get the investigation, may not be in the wider publics best interest, to defer the investigation to allow those with more acute concerns to be investigated instead.","risk_groups":"","impact":7.0,"isMultiSource":false}],"hoverlabel":{"bgcolor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)","bordercolor":"#FF6B6B","font":{"color":"black"}},"hovertemplate":"\u003cb\u003e%{customdata.short_title}\u003c\u002fb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecialty: %{customdata.speciality}\u003cbr\u003eTime: %{customdata.time_point}\u003cbr\u003eDomain: %{customdata.domain}\u003cbr\u003eImpact: %{customdata.impact}\u003cextra\u003e\u003c\u002fextra\u003e","marker":{"color":"rgba(255,255,255,0.98)","line":{"color":"rgba(255,255,255,1)","width":1.0},"opacity":0.88,"size":6,"symbol":"x"},"mode":"markers","name":"Affects All Specialties","showlegend":true,"x":[5.975178425666296,5.972488304287172,5.988128880493203,6.0824673058055465,5.0624112370255885,5.174299476091748],"y":[-0.1445695663852948,3.9649436615568168,3.9421489379421866,1.1302021130870048,0.9095162802113028,0.8884752070386921],"z":[-0.018499122780072513,-0.028122609659614495,-0.07972374791990143,-0.09006967876244382,0.1523756157393646,-0.020472931780755488],"type":"scatter3d"},{"customdata":[{"short_title":"Adverse side effects from changed psychiatric drugs","description":"Patients report adverse side effects from new psychiatric medications, after having to change prescription due to the cyberattack.

We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.\r\n\r\nHe was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.\r\n\r\nEverything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.\r\n\r\nAt one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?\r\n\r\nHis records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.\r\n\r\nIf this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do. I'm very curious to know if this is true for every *** facility in the *** network.","risk_groups":"","impact":8.0,"isMultiSource":false}],"hoverlabel":{"bgcolor":"rgba(255, 255, 255,

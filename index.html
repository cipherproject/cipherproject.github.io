      <h1 class="title" style="margin:10px 0 6px;">The CIPHER Cube Models</h1>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        <b>CIPHER</b> was built to model <b>C</b>yberattack <b>I</b>mpacts, <b>P</b>atient <b>H</b>arms and effective <b>E</b>mergency <b>R</b>esponse during IT downtime at healthcare organisations.
        To do this, our research collected examples of patient harms occuring during healthcare cyberattacks from diverse data sources, to form one combined
        <b>'CIPHER database' </b>.
        The CIPHER models on this page draw from our two key datasets described on the <a href="https://www.thecipherplatform.com">project website</a>, consisting of <b>(1) The "Hospital Attacks"</b> dataset (a systematic review of
        global papers reporting healthcare cyberattacls), and <b>(2) The "Patient Harms"</b> dataset (extracted through data mining social media posts). 
        From these two sources we created the full <b>CIPHER dataset</b>, available in the data folder in the GitHub Repo,
        which provides over <b>300 patient-level harms</b> reported to have occured following a healthcare cyberattack.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        Below you will find the <b>interactive "Hospital at Ransom" cube</b>, which is a demo model built from the CIPHER database, developed for a hypothetical hospital context.
        For these models to be effective for local hospital context, users would need to update the underlying data for the likely clinical impact in their hospitals. 
        For instance, we have assigned 'Clinical Impact' scores to each patient safety incident in the CIPHER dataset, based on the likely effect in our hypothetical hospital (e.g. this hospital
        has a heavy reliance on e-Prescribing in the ER, thus loss of digital drug release would have a high degree of impact). By downloading the underlying datasets
        and contextualising impact for local circumstances, users can utilise the database of cyberattack-induced patient safety incidents and tailor the model to their environment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        The demo model provides an approach for <b>minimising clinical surprise</b> during
        hospital cyberattacks, by predicting potential adverse events from hour 1 of the cyberattack, to day 28. 
        Users can filted the model to examine harms relevant to <b>specifical technical domains</b> (e.g. safety incidents related to loss of the laboratory systems) or <b>specific clinical areas</b> (e.g. harms likely to occur on paediatrics wards).
        The full models on the <a href="https://www.thecipherplatform.com">project website</a> can also be manipulated to plot the 'Clinical Impact' scores on the Y axis,
        thus providing time-series predictions of potential clinical harm over time (from 24 hours to Day 28).
        By showcasing these diverse events, assigning clinical impact scores and identifying
        the at-risk patient groups and necessary medical interventions, these models can be used to enhance Cyberattack incident response processes to protect patient care.

Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome. However, it could also be extremely challenging, for example, when two or more patients with similar injuries required a CT scan for surgical planning. Decision-makers could be placed in the difficult situation where the patient\u2019s best interest, to get the investigation, may not be in the wider publics best interest, to defer the investigation to allow those with more acute concerns to be investigated instead.","risk_groups":"","impact":7.0,"isMultiSource":false},{"short_title":"Cancelled outpatient appointments","description":"The cancellation of outpatient appointments due to the cyberattack may affect patients in the community who miss specialist appointments.","time_point":"Week 1","speciality":"All","domain":"Booking Systems","ref_title":"A retrospective impact analysis of the WannaCry cyberattack on the NHS","ref_link":"https:\u002f\u002fwww.nature.com\u002farticles\u002fs41746-019-0161-6","quote":"The attack also affected outpatient services.

They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.\r\n\r\nEverything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.\r\n\r\nAt one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?\r\n\r\nHis records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.\r\n\r\nIf this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do. I'm very curious to know if this is true for every *** facility in the *** network.","risk_groups":"","impact":8.0,"isMultiSource":false},{"short_title":"Cancelled oncology follow up appointments raising risk of recurrence and deterioration","description":"Patients have their cancer follow up appointments cancelled during the cyberattack, raising the risk of cancers returning or advancing.","time_point":"Week 1","speciality":"Oncology","domain":"Booking Systems","ref_title":"Social Media","ref_link":"https:\u002f\u002freddit.com\u002fr\u002fthyroidcancer\u002fcomments\u002fjrtc4o\u002ffollow_up_keeps_getting_postponed\u002f","quote":"I had my TT in August 2019.

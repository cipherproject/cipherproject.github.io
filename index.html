      <h1 class="title" style="margin:10px 0 6px;">The CIPHER Cube Models</h1>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        <b>CIPHER</b> was built to model <b>C</b>yberattack <b>I</b>mpacts, <b>P</b>atient <b>H</b>arms and effective <b>E</b>mergency <b>R</b>esponse during IT downtime at healthcare organisations.
        To do this, our research collected examples of patient harms occuring during healthcare cyberattacks from diverse data sources, to form one combined
        <b>'CIPHER database' </b>.
        The CIPHER models on this page draw from our two key datasets described on the <a href="https://www.thecipherplatform.com">project website</a>, consisting of <b>(1) The "Hospital Attacks"</b> dataset (a systematic review of
        global papers reporting healthcare cyberattacks), and <b>(2) The "Patient Harms"</b> dataset (extracted through data mining social media posts). 
        From these two sources we created the full <b>CIPHER dataset</b>, available in the data folder in the GitHub Repo,
        which provides over <b>300 patient-level harms</b> reported to have occured following a healthcare cyberattack.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        Below you will find the <b>interactive "Hospital at Ransom" cube</b>, which is a demo model built from the CIPHER database, developed for a hypothetical hospital context.
        For these models to be effective for local hospital context, users would need to update the underlying data for the likely clinical impact in their hospitals. 
        For instance, we have assigned 'Clinical Impact' scores to each patient safety incident in the CIPHER dataset, based on the likely effect in our hypothetical hospital (e.g. this hospital
        has a heavy reliance on e-Prescribing in the ER, thus loss of digital drug release would have a high degree of impact). By downloading the underlying datasets
        and contextualising impact for local circumstances, users can utilise the database of cyberattack-induced patient safety incidents and tailor the model to their environment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        The demo model provides an approach for <b>minimising clinical surprise</b> during
        hospital cyberattacks, by predicting potential adverse events from hour 1 of the cyberattack, to day 28. 
        Users can filted the model to examine harms relevant to <b>specifical technical domains</b> (e.g. safety incidents related to loss of the laboratory systems) or <b>specific clinical areas</b> (e.g. harms likely to occur on paediatrics wards).
        The full models on the <a href="https://www.thecipherplatform.com">project website</a> can also be manipulated to plot the 'Clinical Impact' scores on the Y axis,
        thus providing time-series predictions of potential clinical harm over time (from 24 hours to Day 28).
        By showcasing these diverse events, assigning clinical impact scores and identifying
        the at-risk patient groups and necessary medical interventions, these models can be used to enhance Cyberattack incident response processes to protect patient care.

Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome.

This really confused me because I got it in October with the discount card.\r\n\r\nI have tried pretty much all the ADHD medications and have always suffered from terrible side effects. Azstarys was the first one that didn\u2019t make me feel like a zombie and make me anxious, irritable, grumpy, and antisocial at the end of the day. I\u2019ve tried Adderall XR, Adderall IR, Vyvanse, Ritalin, Focalin, Strattera, Jornay, Qulbree, and Intuniv. Azstarys was the first one that made me feel hopeful again!\r\n\r\nAny advice as what to do? I honestly thought the discount card could be used without insurance, and that it didn\u2019t matter what my insurance said. And why are they not approving it now when they did in October? Has this happened to anyone else? Some advice would be great. I will call my insurance tomorrow when they open but don\u2019t even know what to say.

We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.\r\n\r\nHe was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.\r\n\r\nEverything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.\r\n\r\nAt one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?\r\n\r\nHis records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.\r\n\r\nIf this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do.

Apparently there was a data breach with whatever databases they use and they have been backlogged with applications and the verification process has been delayed.\r\n\r\nI sent in my application on December 22, 2021, and on the website it shows that I have an active enrollment in Medicaid, but my Managed Care Organization (MCO) is still pending state approval.  Maryland Health Connection hasn\u2019t been particularly helpful. I\u2019ve called them multiple times and I get different answers from different people. One representative even said that my MCO was approved but that is clearly not the case.\r\n\r\nThe most recent representative I spoke to confirmed that I am active in Medicaid but my MCO is still pending due to the data breach. They also said that my coverage began on December 1 because coverage starts the month you apply. However they then said that I won\u2019t be active until late February. I have no idea what this means and when I asked for further clarification they pretty much said verbatim the same thing over again. How can my coverage begin if I\u2019m not active? What is being active? Can someone please explain? This has been a nightmare.\r\n\r\nAlso, the representative said that I can use my Medicaid ID number if I go to the doctor in the meantime (since I haven\u2019t received any ID card or documentation in the mail) and Medicaid will receive whatever bills my doctor is issuing out. Is this a legit thing to do? Has anyone done this before?

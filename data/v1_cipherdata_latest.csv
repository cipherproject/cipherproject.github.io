As with plain radiography, the only way to view these images in detail was at the CT unit itself. Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome. However, it could also be extremely challenging, for example, when two or more patients with similar injuries required a CT scan for surgical planning.

First, all severe trauma from around the wider catchment region of the hospital was diverted to other hospitals. This meant that those patients most affected by this rationing of investigations were those with mild-to-moderate trauma akin to the ‘walking wounded’ in the mass casualty setting (e.g. ankle or distal radius fractures), which made up most of the patient load in orthopaedic surgery during this time. This is different to that seen in a mass casualty situation where the injuries are often more time critical, and the clinician may be faced with making a series of decisions almost simultaneously that have immediate or very short-term impact on life or limb.

NHS makes urgent appeal for blood donations after cyberattack on London hospitals,https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj.q1277.full,Cancellation of transplant surgeries,The impact of the cyberattack on the ability of hospitals to cross-match patient blood type led to the cancellation of transplant surgeries,"The NHS has made an urgent appeal for O blood type donors in response to the cyberattack that forced some of the largest hospitals in London to cancel operations and divert patients to other trusts. The ransomware attack on Synnovis, a provider of pathology services, on 3 June prompted trusts using the IT service to declare a critical incident because of the impact on areas including transplant surgeries and blood transfusions. Guy’s and St Thomas’—one of the trusts affected—asked medical students to assist in delivering blood tests while IT systems are down, according to a memo obtained by the Sunday Times.1",First Week,"General Surgery, Oncology",ePrescribing,8

Social Media,https://reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ajkr9v/lurie_childrens_hospital_cyberattack/,Cancelled elective procedures for patients,Family members reporting cancellation of their non-emergency procedure due to cyberattack,"Hello. For privacy I'm going to be vague but my family has been seriously affected by the cyberattack on *** in ***. We were actually at the hospital, prepping for a procedure when they realized what was happening and cancelled all non-emergency procedures.

The messaging from the hospital has been minimal and frustrating. The call line they set up was not very helpful either. In addition, local news has not really been able to shed more light on the situation. I'm wondering if you fine folks might have some inside knowledge on what could be happening? I assume the reason the hospital is not saying a lot has to due with the severity of the situation? It seems like this has affected more than just records and phones. Why else would they cancel important procedures?

I guess I don't have a really specific question just looking for some expert opinions and thoughts on the situation. Thanks!

UPDATE: The hospital called yesterday and our procedure is going forward very soon. So, essential equipment and systems must be up and running now. Thanks for all the informative comments and discussion!",First Week,Paediatrics; General Surgery; ENT; Orthopaedics; Obstetrics,Operating Rooms,6
Social Media,https://reddit.com/r/braincancer/comments/1d45ocu/has_anyone_else_been_affected_by_the_ascension/,"Tumour recurrence and detrioration, due to cancelled follow up","Relative reports the return of a patient’s grade 4 glioblastoma and worsening of symptoms, after a hospital cyberattack prevented them contacting the hospital and obtaining follow up appointments.","My ***'s care for grade 4 glioblastoma was delayed due to the ransomware. We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.

He was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.

Everything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.

At one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?

His records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.

If this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do. I'm very curious to know if this is true for every *** facility in the *** network.",First Month,Oncology,Communications,8

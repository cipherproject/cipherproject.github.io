As with plain radiography, the only way to view these images in detail was at the CT unit itself. Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome.

First, all severe trauma from around the wider catchment region of the hospital was diverted to other hospitals. This meant that those patients most affected by this rationing of investigations were those with mild-to-moderate trauma akin to the ‘walking wounded’ in the mass casualty setting (e.g. ankle or distal radius fractures), which made up most of the patient load in orthopaedic surgery during this time. This is different to that seen in a mass casualty situation where the injuries are often more time critical, and the clinician may be faced with making a series of decisions almost simultaneously that have immediate or very short-term impact on life or limb.

We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.

He was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.

Everything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.

At one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?

His records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.

","My biggest point of burnout is that we have some people that basically refuse to work because it’s not the process we’re all accustomed to (not that the coworkers I’m referring to here were ever good/helpful even in the best of times to begin with, but people depend on us at least attempting to do our jobs) and that the leads are power-tripping HARD. Basically our whole system of doing things in downtime changes based on what leads are present and our higher leadership isn’t standardizing processes. We’ve had scheduled downtimes before this as well as unscheduled ones (no longer than 12 hours, but usually between 1-3 hours), so I feel like my lab should have a standardized process for this by now? This gets really confusing for us on the swing shift like me because we deal with all members of leadership and have to change our whole process in the middle of our shifts depending on who’s there even though us lowly MLTs & MLSs will give feedback about each process. My other beef is with blood bank, since we don’t get automated printouts of prep & trans orders, I either have to hope the hematology/coag tech is reliably communicating crits to me or I have to get handwritten orders and half the time neither of those things are happening (if I even receive pink tops since I have to treat most patients as having only partial or no history) so I’ll just have to be met with bullshit when I explain that I need a min to prep the blood or that I need a T&S because I wasn’t even aware the patient needed product.

I feel like this confusion about processes will ultimately lead to mixups and mistakes. I take my work seriously and I’m just burnt out because I have less ability to monitor things for myself to make sure my work is actually getting done and done well.

It became apparent to me that she had like, no clue what the heck she was doing- and by the power of ADHD and pure determination I taught myself how to bill and code for our practice and got our billing situation at least for the 2023 year- i'm still hard at work repairing accounts. Debts written off as bad ins when it's a pt debt, not applying and allocating funds to the correct line items- billing thru mailed hcfa's when there was electronic payer ids, and the worst one- never updating the fee schedule/ billing 92 codes/ never telling the dr about no one paying ***'s other than the local medi-cal ins and like, tricare. It was reallly bad, the Dr was furious. I managed to put the fire out in oct of last year. In january they decided to switch to the ***+ function of DR Chrono, handing over the billing process to them completely aside from the coding (which I still do). It's been rough.   The Change cyber attack has put everything into disarray, and the *** billing team is very bad at communicating stuff. I dont think the manager really understands what it takes to move to a different clearinghouse, we've been stuck not getting medicare or tricare payments because she hasn't enrolled with them. It sucks!! I have discovered I have a real love for billing and coding, it just clicks with me. I don't think they want me to get accredited because they would have to pay me more than 21$ an hr lol.

I will say though, even if your doctor will not provide you with a paper script, if you’re on an opioid or narcotic and need your refill or you’ll go into withdrawal, your doctor will find a way to get them to you.

I was scared because that computer has been in my room where I get dressed and sleep. I completely wiped the computer and I took it to an e-waste facility to destroy it.

When CT doesn't have the patient chart in front of them, they can't double check for a contrast allergy.

Even though we’re writing down our time cards, we’re having issues such as
- people whose pay rate is randomly changed
- I write down I worked 72 hours but I get paid for some other random number like 68 hours
- constant requests to work overtime but when you do you don’t get paid for it
- random deduction or additions to the pto balance on checks whether you used any hours or not, or the hours saying 0
- no checks at all
- gross overpayments

So we fill out a paper time card and if your check is wrong you’re supposed to fill out a correction paper which is basically a repeat of what I put on the first paper.

Under viral attack: An orthopaedic response to challenges faced by regional referral centres during a national cyber-attack,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34782238/,Risks of intra-operative complications for orthopaedic patients due to loss of digital templating software,"Digital templating is a key preoperative planning method that uses digital software to overlay templtaes on radigraphs to predict and select implant size and position, to improve surgical outcomes. Loss of this software may impact patients have arthroplasty surgeries resulting in worse surgical outcomes. ","The success of many Orthopaedic procedures is contingent on careful preoperative planning. Templating of prosthetic components using preoperative radiographs is a safe and accurate method of assessing component sizes for joint arthroplasty. Templating can aid preoperative planning such that component sizes can be predicted with a greater degree of accuracy, which is beneficial in cases where sizes with reduced availability are required. The introduction of computer-based software systems have been an integral aid to the orthopaedic surgeon in creating digital templates for both hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. Similarly, the use of fluoroscopy can be used as an intraoperative aid for removal of metal, and intra-articular injections for pain relief. Infiltration of the electronic system prevented clinician access to patient preoperative x-rays. Data regarding previous operations, sizes and implants used was similarly unavailable. Digital templating was also sequestered during the cyberattack.",First Week,Orthopaedics,Imaging,7

Patients presenting with trauma can be triaged to assess the need for immediate intervention, or virtual follow up; with a decision on conservative or interventional management made thereafter. No access to radiological imaging, laboratory results or medical history carried out off-site was available as a direct result of the imaging server infection, limiting facilitation of referral to regional units, due to insufficient information available to aid clinical decision making. Similarly, reduced access to radiological imaging on site with no desktop access to imaging similarly resulted in limited assessment of inpatients and patients presenting to the outpatient and emergency departments in the radiology department of each regional unit. With reduced access to these systems trauma clinicians were required to circumnavigate the challenges imposed by the cybersecurity attack to preserve the standard of patient care.",First Day,Emergency & Acute Medicine; Orthopaedics; General Surgery,Imaging,8

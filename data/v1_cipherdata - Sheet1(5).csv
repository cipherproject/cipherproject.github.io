As with plain radiography, the only way to view these images in detail was at the CT unit itself. Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome. However, it could also be extremely challenging, for example, when two or more patients with similar injuries required a CT scan for surgical planning.

First, all severe trauma from around the wider catchment region of the hospital was diverted to other hospitals. This meant that those patients most affected by this rationing of investigations were those with mild-to-moderate trauma akin to the ‘walking wounded’ in the mass casualty setting (e.g. ankle or distal radius fractures), which made up most of the patient load in orthopaedic surgery during this time.

We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.

He was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.

Everything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.

At one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?

His records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.

If this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do. I'm very curious to know if this is true for every *** facility in the *** network.",First Month,Oncology,Communications,8

There are plenty of other clearinghouses out there but they all communicate to these companies through Change. Since then, the biggest problem is a lack of a timeline. Even now I have no idea when they'll be ""back"". The lab I spoke of mentioned that it would take a month to develop a new interface to get around Change so they were going to sit tight and hope Change would be back up soon. I'm guessing they're probably regretting that decision around now. Availity (the clearinghouse we work with) sends out updates with messages like ""here are the payers we were able to get alternate interfaces for, you'll need to sign this paperwork to get access to the connections then if Change comes back online we may or may not have to switch back and force everyone to re-enroll."" Claims connections are more-or-less working at this point so doctors are billing and getting paid, but the remittance connections are not up, so I have doctors who have $50k+ of deposits in their bank that they have no idea what for.",First Week,All,ePrescribing,4

It’s crazy that she brought this up as I was scouring this sub for any gleam of hope right before driving there lol. I even double-clarified with her by asking, Yes there used to be one which expired last year.. but you’re saying that they’ve created a new one?

When I got the prescription, the bottle said only take it once per day, and there were only 30 pills. So it was only going to last me 15 days instead of a month.

A major platform that processes information to providers and facilities is under cyberattack and currently not transmitting information until further notice.  The platform is called Change Healthcare which is owned by United Healthcare.  Doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare professionals are unable to access patient insurance eligibility, benefits or even verify coverage.  I’ve been reading that CVS has been particularly affected with both receiving electronic RX from doctors and checking patient benefits for their medications.  Because of this interruption, CVS is focusing on dispensing medication to the patients with life threatening conditions and when they do, may be charging full price because they have no access to what the co-pays are.  What an absolute mess.

If it’s time for your monthly refill, avoid sending the RX to CVS if at all possible.  We all know that medications for ADHD are already difficult to obtain and not usually prioritized by pharmacies, this certainly won’t help.  Plus they’re scrambling to operate without their systems working, so it’s most likely a shit show.  Because insurance info cannot be pulled, prepare to pay full price.

At the very least they should be able to provide you w/a projected time and date when the situation will be resolved. There is a reason that the laws have exceptions to the rules built right into them.

It might take calling some pharmacies and it might end with some headaches but trust me, the last thing a doctor wants is their patient to go into withdrawal and then be sued.  Just PLEASE be kind to all the medical staff. I can’t begin to tell you how many patients have made me cry this week over this",First Week,General Medicine; Neurology; Psychiatry,ePrescribing,6

Change Healthcare does have a status page where they are listing the status of their recovery efforts but I don't see discount card processing listed.",Week 2,Neurology,ePrescribing,4

The phone system is voice over internet protocol and thus depended on the computer network, which resulted in loss of phone access in the initial days of the cyberattack. To assist with the volume of phone inquiries, the Medical Center’s central ICT, along with the Office of Patient and Family Advocacy, coordinated a centralized phone-answering service that patients could call with questions and concerns.

This fell to 41 patients in the 4-week period during the cyberattack and quickly recovered to 323 patients in the 4 weeks after the attack. Similarly, there was an impact on trial enrollment, 49 patients were enrolled in clinical trials in the 4 weeks before the attack, 22 during the cyberattack, and recovering to 38 patients in the 4 weeks after the attack.

Centers are busy trying to fix it and may not call to let you know before your appointment, so please be patient with them. Call the center before you travel if you are worried about this, or if you have to travel a long way to get there.

Several centers were able to get things running again this morning, so only donations between 7AM-9AM were affected, so don't let this discourage you.

They say it affects those with ADHD way more than the non-ADHD population.

If you’re dealing with this, how are you coping?

I was diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood despite fighting it my whole life. People just thought I was a daydreamer and lazy and an underachiever. I have been in therapy for 13 years but I still don’t really know how to “adult.”

I am in the *** and was without health insurance for the past year (well technically I “had” medical assistance but due to a cyberattack there was a 12-month delay in me being able to see any doctors or get any meds).

Today is my first day back on Adderall after a new nurse practitioner had pulled me off it in March 2021 because she thought my blood pressure was a bit too high, despite me telling her it was always high at the start of a dr visit and is usually normal-ish by the end.

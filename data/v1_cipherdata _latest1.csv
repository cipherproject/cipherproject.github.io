As with plain radiography, the only way to view these images in detail was at the CT unit itself. Due to the inability to export the images off the scanner for delayed reporting, the rate of scanning slowed to a point where just two scans per hour were being performed to facilitate simultaneous reporting by radiology staff. Because of the huge stress this put on the Radiology Department there was a concerted effort to limit imaging requests to only those patients who absolutely required it.  *Quote 2*: The rationing of investigations, particularly CT, highlights two key ethical principles. First, beneficence; ensuring that advanced imaging was only being requested for those patients who absolutely required it helped to decrease the burden on the radiology department and ensured that scans could be done and reported on as quickly as possible. Second, justice; deciding which patients warranted further investigation immediately and which did not. This could be easy at times, for example, prioritising a CT brain for a patient with head trauma where there is an urgent need to make an assessment and plan intervention over a patient with a periarticular fracture requiring a CT scan for preoperative planning where a delay is unlikely to impact the clinical outcome. However, it could also be extremely challenging, for example, when two or more patients with similar injuries required a CT scan for surgical planning.

First, all severe trauma from around the wider catchment region of the hospital was diverted to other hospitals. This meant that those patients most affected by this rationing of investigations were those with mild-to-moderate trauma akin to the ‘walking wounded’ in the mass casualty setting (e.g. ankle or distal radius fractures), which made up most of the patient load in orthopaedic surgery during this time. This is different to that seen in a mass casualty situation where the injuries are often more time critical, and the clinician may be faced with making a series of decisions almost simultaneously that have immediate or very short-term impact on life or limb.

We had a craniotomy brain resection done at the end of *** & he was doing great. Walking again within 4 days, driving again within 12. Then came the part where we scheduled treatment. We were told we would be contacted, & we weren't. We started calling them & didn't get an answer & nobody returned voicemails. Our case manager was missing in action. I had to get neuro to lean on the oncology side of things to get us a *** appointment, a full 2 months after the surgery where 98% of the tumor was removed. By the time ***th arrived, leftside weakness symptoms had returned. On the morning of the ***th, I couldn't get him to oncology, he was too weak to walk. I had to call 911. And let me tell you...this most recent week we spent at *** was the most chaotic, frustrating, devastating week of my life.

He was left in the ER on a tiny stretcher his *** frame didnt fit on for about 8 hours, in soiled clothes. Every system in the hospital was affected. It was all integrated in the most insane ways. The blood sugar machines, the EHR system, the nurse call buttons, even the credit card machines in the in-hospital restaurants were taken down on May 8, & as of 2 days ago, most things are still down. They got nurse call buttons up as we were leaving, what they had been using was hotel bells in each room to summon nurses.

Everything was being done on paper in that hospital, & it created massive deficits in patient care. My *** had an aspiration procedure to drain 100 CCs of fluid from his brain that had occurred after the resection & didn't reabsorb. His left side weakness resolved again after that. But then he languished in a hospital bed for many more days due to all the delays & how hard it was to get scans, & physical therapy ghosted us, causing nurses to not let him out of bed & causing him to develop a small blood clot in one ankle.

At one point, we were in ICU, & he was supposed to transfer to a regular room that morning. By the afternoon, I determined ICU nurses kept calling that floor & nobody answered the phone. I literally grabbed a notebook & went down there & announced myself as his patient advocate there to check on if his new room had been cleaned & to check on the status of his transfer order. It worked, that got him moved, but how terrifying is it that I had to pretend I worked in the hospital system in order to get him moved?

His records are lost, when I asked medical records department for copies, they said they couldn't help due to the ransomware outage that happened weeks ago. When I asked if they would put in writing that they were denying a cancer patient his medical records, they got freaked out & said absolutely not. I went around them directly to radiology & managed to get some MRI & CT scan reports.

If this is happening to anyone else, let's talk. Let's compare notes. One thing I heard from a nurse was that they had worked in many hospitals across the country, & *** was the first place they worked where there were no training drills for a system outage. It was chaos because staff had literally never been trained on what to do. I'm very curious to know if this is true for every *** facility in the *** network.",First Month,Oncology,Communications,8

Basically our whole system of doing things in downtime changes based on what leads are present and our higher leadership isn’t standardizing processes. We’ve had scheduled downtimes before this as well as unscheduled ones (no longer than 12 hours, but usually between 1-3 hours), so I feel like my lab should have a standardized process for this by now?
